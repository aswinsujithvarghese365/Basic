"""Problem
Vasya likes the number 239. Therefore, he considers a number pretty if its last digit is 2, 3 or 9.
Vasya wants to watch the numbers between L and R (both inclusive), so he asked you to determine how many pretty numbers are in this range. Can you help him?

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of pretty numbers between L and R."""

    l2 = [str(y) for y in l]
